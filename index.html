            <h2 id="features">Customizable UI Features</h2>
            <p>
                Customizable UI features allow users to personalize their experience on a website or application,
                tailoring the interface to their needs and preferences. These features improve accessibility, user
                satisfaction, and overall usability. Specifically:

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Dark Mode: This feature provides a darker color scheme for the UI, which can be easier on the eyes,
                    especially in low-light environments. Many users prefer dark mode for aesthetic reasons or to reduce
                    eye
                    strain during extended use, particularly in the evening.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Font Size Toggle: Allowing users to adjust font size is essential for accessibility. People with
                    visual
                    impairments or those who find text difficult to read can increase the font size to suit their
                    preferences. This ensures that the website or app is usable by a broader range of users.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Animations Toggle: Some users may find animations distracting, overwhelming, or even triggering in
                    certain cases (e.g., motion sensitivity or epilepsy). Offering a toggle to turn off animations lets
                    users customize their experience, making the interface more comfortable for them.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2 id="features">On-Scroll Animation</h2>
            <p>
                On-scroll animations are important because they can significantly enhance user engagement by adding
                visual interest and dynamism to a website.
                They can draw attention to important elements, encourage exploration, and leave a positive impression on
                visitors.

            <!-- Parallax-->
            <h2 id="parallax">Parallax Effect</h2>
            <p>
                Parallax is when things closer to you seem to move faster than things farther away. Imagine looking out
                a car windowâ€”nearby trees zoom by, but distant mountains barely seem to move. Websites use this idea to
                make scrolling feel more interactive by moving different layers on the page at different speeds.
            </p>

            <div class="bgimg-1">
                <h1 class="title" style="text-align:center;">Scroll Down!</h1>
            </div>
            <section class="mt-2">This is a simple parallax scrolling, which is just one fixed image in the background
                where your
                other divs can scroll past!</section>
            <p>
                <br><strong>Implementation Steps:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Define a div container with a specific height for the parallax background in your HTML file.</li>
                <li>Apply CSS styles to create the parallax effect. The parallax scrolling effect is achieved using
                    properties like
                    <code>background-attachment: fixed;</code>. The other background properties are used to center and
                    scale the image perfectly
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>background-attachment: fixed; </code>ensures that the background stays fixed as the user
                        scrolls.</li>
                    <li><code>min-height: 400px; </code>sets a fixed height for the background container.</li>
                    <li><code>background-size: cover; </code>makes sure the image covers the entire div.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>

            <div class="bgimg-3">
                <h1 class="title" style="text-align:center;">Scroll Down!</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="bgimg-2">
                <h1 class="title" style="text-align:center;">Scroll Down!</h1>
            </div>

            <h2 id="parallax" class="mt-2">Multi-Layer Parallax Effect</h2>
            <p>
                Multi-layer parallax scrolling involves multiple images moving at different speeds to enhance the depth
                effect. This is achieved using the perspective and transform properties in CSS.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="wrapper">
            <div class="div2">
                <img src="Mountain.png" class="background">
                <img src="Trees.png" class="foreground">
            </div>
            <section id="section_1">
                This effect was originally used in early video games (like the classic Moon Patrol from 1982) to
                create a sense of depth using multiple layers moving at different speeds. In modern web design, it's
                used to create engaging, immersive experiences and guide users' attention through content in an
                interesting way.
                <br><br>
                Parallax graphics can hold a user's attention and improve engagement, you can use parallax scrolling
                to produce a one-page website where visitors can read an entire story about your product or brand
                without navigating to multiple pages.

                    <h2 id="parallax">Understanding the Code</h2>
                    <p>
                        Similar to the simple parallax scrolling, we must first define the structure in HTML and then
                        apply CSS.
                        <br><br>
                        The key concepts that can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/vivada-lokugamage/SIT774-10.4HD">github</a> code:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Perspective - Defines how far objects appear in 3D space <code>perspective: 10px;</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li>Layering - Background and foreground images are placed inside a container <code>div2</code>
                        </li>
                        <li>Transformations - Each layer moves at different speeds using <code> translateZ</code>. Here
                            background will move slower than foreground.</li>
                        <li>Preserve 3D - Ensures that layers remain in a 3D space using
                            <code>transform-style: preserve-3d;</code>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    How it works:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <code>.wrapper</code> sets up a scrolling area with a 3D perspective.</li>
                        <li>Inside <code>.div2</code>, two images (background and foreground) are placed.</li>
                        <li>The background is moved further back <code>(translateZ(-10px) scale(2);)</code> , making it
                            appear slower.</li>
                        <li>The foreground is slightly closer <code>(translateZ(-5px) scale(1.5);)</code>, making it
                            move faster.</li>
                        <li>Both images are absolutely positioned to overlap and create the parallax effect.</li>
                    </ul>
